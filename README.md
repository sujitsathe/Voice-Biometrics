# Voice-Biometrics üîê

This project implements a **voice authentication system** to securely unlock a folder. The system uses **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** for feature extraction and a similarity threshold to match user voices during authentication.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Voice Registration**: Record and store your voice securely for future authentication.
- **Voice Authentication**: Authenticate using your voice to unlock a protected folder.
- **Secure Folder Access**: Only authorized users can access the folder.
